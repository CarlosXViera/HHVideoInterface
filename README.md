Haunted Hotel Video Interface for Entertainment Technology Department.
We used Max MSP "visual" programming environment to create a candid camera system that allowed users to record frightening moments. This is specifically made with the intentions to streamline our haunted hotel attraction that is hosted yearly at New York College of Technology. Below is a screenshot of the system.
